// What's this ?
A Processing/Java application to control stage lighting, including DMX, LED matrixes, and other custom devices.
This application is taylor-made for the electro-rock band PlayMe, though it could be adapted for other shows.
It can be controlled using MIDI and audio, directly from the DAW and from the various keyboards/controllers available.

// How do I build it ?
Install the Processing development environment : http://processing.org/
The following libraries are used in this App:
Controlp5  : used to build the GUI
themidibus : used to parse any incoming MIDI message
protobuf   : Google Protocol Buffer 2.5.0, used to parse incoming audio data
This program is not yet in its final release version, which is why no binary release is available.

// How do I use it ?
Connect all the different devices you want to use : Teensy 3 microcontrollers for the LED panels, Teensy 2 for 
the DMX output, Arduino Nano for the custom wireless devices...
Start Strobot, and control it either from the GUI (not recommended), or from your DAW (much better)
This application is to be used with the VST/AU plugin SignalProcessor (also available on my GitHub), which allows sending
audio informations (signal waveform + beat detection) directly from each channel in your DAW, as well as useful data, such as the 
current BPM or the transport position. Without it, some cool features will not work (automatic mode, DMX animations, audio-related stuff)
