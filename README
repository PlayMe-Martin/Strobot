// What's this ?
A Processing/Java application to control stage lighting, including DMX, LED matrixes, and other custom devices.
This application is taylor-made for the electronic music band XI, though it could be adapted for other shows.
It can be controlled using MIDI and audio, directly from the DAW and from the various keyboards/controllers available.

// Disclaimer
The code inside this was not written to be publicly released as some kind of big open-source project, which is why a 
certain degree of freedom was taken with coding rules, but hey it works. Some of the code is currently undergoing a 
rewrite to comply with everyone's sense of esthetics

// What can I control with it
Mainly DMX and homebrew equipment
The LED panels use a custom protocol (to be detailed), same goes for the LED tubes

// How do I use it ?
Connect all the different devices you want to use : Teensy 3 microcontrollers for the LED panels, Teensy 2 for 
the DMX output, Arduino Nano for the custom wireless devices...
Start Strobot, and control it either from the GUI (not recommended), or from your DAW (much better)
This application is to be used with the VST/AU plugin SignalProcessor (also available on my GitHub), which allows sending
audio informations (signal waveform + beat detection) directly from each channel in your DAW, as well as useful data, such as the 
current BPM or the transport position. Without it, some cool features will not work (automatic mode, DMX animations, audio-related stuff)
