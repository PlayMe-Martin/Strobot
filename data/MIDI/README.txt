Put in this folder all the MIDI clips youâ€™d like to be processed automatically by Strobot.
At startup, Strobot will initialize an internal library from these clips, and pick from these data to do the automatic mode.
The different folders are quite explanatory, animations which are sparse and calm go in Low_Intensity, and eternal strobes go in High_Intensity.
