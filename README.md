// What's this ?
A Processing/Java application to control stage lighting, including DMX, LED matrixes, and other custom devices. This application is taylor-made for the electro-rock band PlayMe, and though it could be adapted for other shows, it would need some rework to make it as useful

// How do I build it ?
Install the Processing development environment : http://processing.org/
The following Processing libraries are used in this App:
Controlp5  : used to build the GUI
themidibus : used to parse any incoming MIDI message

// How do I use it ?
Connect all the different devices you want to use : Teensy 3 microcontrollers for the LED panels, Teensy 2 for the DMX output, Arduino Nano for the custom wireless devices...
And simply launch the application, the rest is self-explanatory.
